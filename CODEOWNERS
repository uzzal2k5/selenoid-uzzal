# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the /tests/api
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
